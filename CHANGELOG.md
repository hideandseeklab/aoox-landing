## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0-alpha.1] - 2026-09-26

### Added

- One-line installer: `curl -fsSL https://aoox.dev/install.sh | sh` (`public/install.sh`) sets up
  the panel on a fresh Linux VPS — installs Docker if missing, generates secrets, and starts the
  stack, configurable via env vars (`WEB_DOMAIN`/`API_DOMAIN`/`ACME_EMAIL`, `ADMIN_EMAIL`/
  `ADMIN_PASSWORD`/`ADMIN_NAME`). Mirrors `aoox install` in aoox-cli but needs no Node.js to run.
  Featured on the landing page's self-host section and CTA, and as the primary path in the
  Installation doc.
- English translation of every documentation page (`/en/docs/*`, mirroring `/docs/*` 1:1) — the
  language switcher now works on docs pages too, not just the landing page.
- New "Domain panel" doc content covering the dashboard/CLI way to set a custom domain for the
  panel itself (`aoox domain set`), alongside the existing manual `docker-compose.domain.yml` steps.
- CLI docs updated for the published `@hideandseeklab/aoox` npm package and the new `aoox domain
  set` command.
- Registry doc updated with a "Custom domain" section covering the new Traefik-routed registry
  domain feature (dashboard field + `aoox registry domain` CLI command).
- Installation and CLI docs updated with the new "Update aoox" feature (Settings button and
  `aoox update` command) as the primary upgrade path, manual SSH steps kept as an alternative.
- Registry doc updated with a note on the optional S3 storage backend for the self-hosted registry.
- CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`): typecheck + lint + build on every pull request and push to
  `main` — previously the only workflow ran on push to `main` for deploy (`deploy-pages.yml`),
  with no check at all on pull requests.

### Fixed

- Landing page's "Multi-node with Swarm" feature card linked to the wrong doc page (`/docs/deploy`
  instead of `/docs/swarm`).
- "Monitoring & notifications" feature card text omitted webhook as a notification channel.
- `npm run lint` failed immediately on every file (`contextOrFilename.getFilename is not a
  function`) because `eslint@10` removed the legacy `context.getFilename()` API that
  `eslint-plugin-react` (bundled by `eslint-config-next`) still relied on — no version of
  `eslint-plugin-react` supports ESLint 10 yet. Pinned `eslint` back to the latest 9.x
  (`^9.39.0`) and bumped `eslint-config-next` to `16.3.6`. Also fixed the ~300 pre-existing
  `react/no-unescaped-entities` errors and a handful of unused-import warnings this uncovered,
  since lint had never actually run to completion before.
- The `react/no-unescaped-entities` autofix above corrupted `{" "}` whitespace expressions and a
  few JSX attribute values in 4 of the newly-added `/en/docs/*` pages (turned working code like
  `{" "}` into invalid `{&quot; &quot;}`), breaking the TypeScript build. Repaired by hand and
  re-verified with a full `tsc`/`next build` pass.

## [0.1.0-alpha.0] - 2026-09-25

### Added

- Initial public alpha release: marketing site and documentation for aoox (Next.js, Tailwind CSS).
- Landing page (Indonesian + English) covering features, self-host quickstart, and FAQ.
- Documentation pages: installation, creating an application, managed databases, compose,
  previews, registry, webhooks, user roles, the CLI, and troubleshooting.
- Static export + automatic deploy to GitHub Pages on every push to `main`.
